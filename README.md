# I was Navigator to this  code and rawnaq is a driver


# I completed my project to get to know me by adding two lists, one about my favorite movies and the other about the programming languages I know
# I made the user guess a certain number and had 4 attempts and then told him about the correct number 

# I also made a matrix with the types of my favorite food and asked the user to guess my favorite type and made him have several attempts and then told him the truth and finally the number of his correct answers would appear on the page and if he succeeded in identifying me or not
